# Queue:
## Theory:
a queue is a fundamental data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It operates much like a line of people waiting for a service, where the first person to join is the first to be served. Queues find wide applications in algorithms that require efficient management of data in sequential order. They can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Key operations include enqueue (to add an element to the rear), dequeue (to remove an element from the front), and peek (to view the front element without removal). Understanding queues is essential for solving problems that require organized and systematic data processing.

#### Basic operations:
The queue data structure includes the following operations:<br>

EnQueue: Adds an item to the queue. Addition of an item to the queue is always done at the rear of the queue.<br>
DeQueue: Removes an item from the queue. An item is removed or de-queued always from the front of the queue.<br>
isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.<br>
isFull: Checks if the queue is full.<br>
peek: Gets an element at the front of the queue without removing it.<br>
